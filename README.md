# BAKARTY
*Status card/debuff/buff card generator*

Recently I've discovered how useful are cards in Roll20 app. But for me, creating each one of them is a painful process. So I've shifted a problem that would take ma an hour or two, to couple days time. Because that's what we do.

## Features

- create a custom status card with your icon, card background name and description
- download generated card as a `.png` file

## Usage

### Locally

Download the repository and serve it locally on your machine with any HTTP server. For example, you can use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) for node, or [Apache](https://apache.org/).

### Pages

The app is avaiable via Github Pages [here](https://swagnar.github.io/BAKARTY/)
