# BAKARTY
*Status card/debuff/buff card generator*

Recently I've discovered how useful are cards in Roll20 app. But for me, creating each one of them is a painful process. So I've shifted a problem that would take ma an hour or two, to couple days time. Because that's what we do.

Soon I'll add a way to change the background and some other things. For now things work 95% of the time.

## Features

- create a custom status card with your icon, name and description
- download generated card as a `.png` file
